# Sweep.py
To play, provide the number of rows and columns, respectively,
as command line arguments.

```bash
$ sweep.py 4 6
```

By default, each cell has a 20% chance of being a mine.
You can adjust this by passing a third argument between 0 and 1.
For instance, to give each a cell a 55% chance of being a mine:

```bash
$ sweep.py 4 6 0.55
```

Instructions on how to play are given within the game.
